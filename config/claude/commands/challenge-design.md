Play devil's advocate with the approach in $ARGUMENTS:

## Step 1: ANALYSE THE APPROACH
- If $ARGUMENTS is a PR, examine the implementation choices
- If $ARGUMENTS is a file/component, understand the current design
- If $ARGUMENTS describes a problem, consider the proposed solution

## Step 2: CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTIONS
1. What assumptions are we making?
2. What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?
3. What if the requirements were completely different?
4. Where might we be over-engineering?
5. What would the opposite approach look like?
6. What happens when this scales/fails?
7. Are we solving the right problem?

Push back constructively to explore alternatives.
