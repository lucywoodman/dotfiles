Given the current state of $ARGUMENTS, help me decide what to do next:

## Step 1: ASSESS CURRENT STATE
- If $ARGUMENTS is a PR number, review the changes and any feedback
- If $ARGUMENTS is a file/component, understand its current state
- If $ARGUMENTS is "current work", examine recent commits and current diff

## Step 2: NEXT STEPS ANALYSIS
1. What did we just accomplish?
2. What did we learn from this implementation?
3. What are the next 3-5 possible steps?
4. Which step would teach us the most?
5. Which step would add the most value?
6. What questions should we be asking?
7. Are there any risks we should address first?

Help me choose the most valuable next action and explain why.
