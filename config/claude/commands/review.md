Use the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent to review PR $ARGUMENTS in Sandy Metz style.

IMPORTANT: The agent must provide the complete, detailed review output including:
- Full analysis of code changes
- Specific line-by-line feedback with examples
- Educational explanations for each recommendation
- Complete Sandy Metz-style assessment
- All refactoring suggestions with code examples

Do not accept summaries - require the full detailed review content.
