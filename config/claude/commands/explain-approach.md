Before we proceed with $ARGUMENTS, explain the architectural approach:

## Step 1: UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT
- If $ARGUMENTS is a PR number, fetch and analyze the changes
- If $ARGUMENTS is a file/component, examine the current implementation
- If $ARGUMENTS is an issue/ticket number, understand the requirements
- If $ARGUMENTS is "current work", look at recent changes

## Step 2: ARCHITECTURAL EXPLANATION
1. What architectural patterns does this use/suggest?
2. Three different ways we could solve it (simple, scalable, elegant)
3. Trade-offs of each approach
4. Why the current/proposed approach makes sense
5. What could go wrong with this approach
6. How this fits into the broader system

Format as a Sandy Metz-style explanation with clear principles.
