Let's reflect on what we learned from $ARGUMENTS:

## Step 1: GATHER CONTEXT
- If $ARGUMENTS is a PR number, review the changes and any comments/feedback
- If $ARGUMENTS is a file/component, examine what was changed recently
- If $ARGUMENTS is an issue/ticket, look at how it was resolved
- If $ARGUMENTS describes completed work, understand what was accomplished

## Step 2: LEARNING REFLECTION
1. What architectural insights emerged from this work?
2. What patterns did we apply or discover?
3. What worked well in our approach?
4. What would we do differently next time?
5. What principle should we add to Lucy's guidelines?
6. What surprised us during implementation?
7. How does this connect to other work we've done?

## Step 3: DOCUMENT INSIGHTS
- Update the original planning document with these insights
- Note any new patterns or anti-patterns discovered
- Record decisions that could inform future similar work
- Identify areas for further learning or exploration

Focus on extracting transferable knowledge from this specific experience.
